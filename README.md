# 1.Introduction to Programming
   * Programming means giving instructions to a computer to perform specific tasks. 
   * These instructions are written in a programming language like Python, C, or Java.

# 1.1 Basic Understanding of Programming Concepts

# Variables
* Variables are used to store data in a program.

* Think of them as containers that hold values.

# Data Types

Data types tell the computer what kind of data is being stored in a variable.

# Common data types:

* int – Whole numbers (e.g., 5, 100)

* float – Decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14)

* str – Text (e.g., "Hello")

* bool – True or False values

# Loops

Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times.

# Two common types:

* for loop – repeats for a specific number of times

* while loop – repeats until a condition becomes false

# Conditional Statements

* Conditionals help you make decisions in a program.

* They check if something is true or false, and run code accordingly.

# 2. Command Line Basics (CLI)
* It is a text-based way to interact with your computer.
* You type commands instead of using a mouse or GUI (Graphical User Interface).

2.1 Basic Command Line Navigation and Execution of Python Scripts
Basic Navigation Commands
* pwd → Shows your current location (Print Working Directory)

* ls → Lists all files and folders in the current directory

* cd foldername → Moves into a folder

* cd .. → Moves one step back

# 3. Getting Started
# 3.1 Introduction to Python

* Python is a simple and powerful programming language used for web development, data analysis, and automation.
* It has easy syntax and many built-in libraries, making it beginner-friendly.

# 4 . Python Basics: 
# 4.1 Variables and Data Types: 
Understanding variables, numbers, strings, and basic data types.
# varaiable
A variable is like a container used to store data in a program.

# Eg:
name="arjun"

# Data type Numbers: Used to store numeric values
# Eg:
* int (10,5)
* float(1.2,3.3)
* complex(7+5j)
* 
# 2.String:  Used to store text data and enclosed in single or double quotes.
# Eg:
name="Arjun"
city='pondy'
# 3.Boolean (bool): Used for True or False values.
# 4.List: Used to store multiple values in one variable.
# 5.Tuple: Similar to a list, but unchangeable (immutable).
# 6. Dictionary (dict): Stores data in key value pairs

# 4.2 Control Flow (if, else, elif)
# if condition:
* code to run if condition is true
# elif:
* code to run if this condition is true
# else:
* code to run if all conditions are false
# odd or even program
