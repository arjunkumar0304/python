# 1.Introduction to Programming
   * Programming means giving instructions to a computer to perform specific tasks. 
   * These instructions are written in a programming language like Python, C, or Java.

# 1.1 Basic Understanding of Programming Concepts

# Variables
* Variables are used to store data in a program.

* Think of them as containers that hold values.

# Data Types

Data types tell the computer what kind of data is being stored in a variable.

# Common data types:

* int – Whole numbers (e.g., 5, 100)

* float – Decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14)

* str – Text (e.g., "Hello")

* bool – True or False values

# Loops

Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times.

# Two common types:

* for loop – repeats for a specific number of times

* while loop – repeats until a condition becomes false

# Conditional Statements

* Conditionals help you make decisions in a program.

* They check if something is true or false, and run code accordingly.

# 2. Command Line Basics (CLI)
* It is a text-based way to interact with your computer.
* You type commands instead of using a mouse or GUI (Graphical User Interface).

2.1 Basic Command Line Navigation and Execution of Python Scripts
Basic Navigation Commands
* pwd → Shows your current location (Print Working Directory)

* ls → Lists all files and folders in the current directory

* cd foldername → Moves into a folder

* cd .. → Moves one step back

# 3. Getting Started
# 3.1 Introduction to Python

* Python is a simple and powerful programming language used for web development, data analysis, and automation.
* It has easy syntax and many built-in libraries, making it beginner-friendly.

3.2 Installing Python

# 4 . Python Basics: 
# 4.1 Variables and Data Types: 
Understanding variables, numbers, strings, and basic data types.
# varaiable
A variable is like a container used to store data in a program.

# Eg:
name="arjun"

# Data type Numbers: Used to store numeric values
# Eg:
* int (10,5)
* float(1.2,3.3)
* complex(7+5j)
 
# 2.String:
Used to store text data and enclosed in single or double quotes.
# Eg:
name="Arjun"
city='pondy'
# 3.Boolean (bool):
Used for True or False values.
# 4.List:
Used to store multiple values in one variable.
# 5.Tuple:
Similar to a list, but unchangeable (immutable).
# 6. Dictionary (dict): 
Stores data in key value pairs

# 4.2 Control Flow (if, else, elif)
# if condition:
* code to run if condition is true
# elif:
* code to run if this condition is true
# else:
* code to run if all conditions are false
# odd or even program

#  Check Positive, Negative, or Zero

# loop statements:
* For Loop
The for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or range) and execute a block of code multiple times.

# while loop:
The while loop repeats a block of code as long as a condition is True.

# 6 Functions and modules:

# 6.1 Functions:
A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.A function can return data as a result.A function helps avoiding code repetition.
# 6.2 Modules:
Consider a module to be the same as a code library.A file containing a set of functions you want to include in your application.

# 7 Data structures:

# 7.1 Lists:
Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.Lists are created using square brackets.

# dictionaries
A dictionary in Python is a collection of key–value pairs. It is unordered (in older versions), mutable, and indexed by keys. Each key must be unique, and it is used to access the value associated with it.

Mutable – You can add, change, or remove items. Unordered 
# Tuple
A tuple is similar to a list, but you cannot change (add, remove, or modify) its elements after creation.
It is written with round brackets ().

# set
A set is a collection of unique items (no duplicates) that is unordered (the items don’t have a fixed position).
It is written using curly braces {}.

# File handling 
process of creating, opening, reading, writing, updating, and deleting files using Python’s built-in functions. It allows a program to store data permanently on a storage device, so it can be retrieved or modified later.

Write in it → add new information

Read from it → see the stored information

Append → add more content without erasing existing content

Delete → remove the file completely

Python gives you the tools (functions) to do these operations

*  `'r'`   Only read, error if file not exist    Reading saved data                 
*  `'w'`    Write, overwrites if file exists        Saving new data                    
*  `'a'`     Append, adds content at end             Adding new info without losing old 
* `'x'`    Create, fails if file exists            Create new files safely            
* `'r+'`    Read + write                             Update existing files

# OOPS:
OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of “objects”, which contain data (attributes) and functions (methods) that operate on that data.

# Class:
A blueprint for creating objects.
# Object:
An instance of a class.

# Encapsulation:
Hiding data and methods inside a class.

# Inheritance:
One class can inherit properties of another.

# Polymorphism:
Same method name can have different behaviors.

# Abstraction:
Hiding complex details and showing only the essential

# Error handling
handle runtime errors (errors that occur while a program is running) so that the program does not crash unexpectedly.
* try  Code that might cause an error
* except  Code to handle the error
* else  Runs only if no error occurs
* finally  Runs always, even if there’s an error
